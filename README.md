# Agent Genia Research

Static web app for Agent Genia ecommerce research. The user writes one natural-language request on the main page; the agent infers intent and calls internal tools such as Alibaba sourcing, Meta/Amazon/TikTok research, negotiation drafting, DDP checks, and quality checks without sending the user into a separate flow.

The app can run in two modes:

- Guided static mode: works in any static host and shows the same main-page cockpit with inferred tool routing.
- Codex harness mode: Cloudflare Pages calls `/api/research`, which proxies to a private harness server that runs `codex exec` with the local Codex authentication and the local `$alibaba-sourcing-agent` skill. This is the production mode where Agent Genia decides whether to call Alibaba sourcing as an internal tool and returns results to the main page.

## Local skill

This machine has the production sourcing skill installed at:

```bash
~/.codex/skills/alibaba-sourcing-agent
```

The harness prompt invokes `$alibaba-sourcing-agent`. If the harness runs on another machine, install or copy that skill there first.

## Local harness

Generate two secrets:

```bash
export HARNESS_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
export APP_PASSWORD="$(openssl rand -hex 12)"
```

Run the harness on the trusted machine where `codex` is logged in:

```bash
HARNESS_TOKEN="$HARNESS_TOKEN" node server/harness-server.mjs
```

Expose it through Cloudflare Tunnel:

```bash
cloudflared tunnel --url http://127.0.0.1:8788
```

Use the generated `https://*.trycloudflare.com` URL as `HARNESS_URL`.

## Cloudflare Pages

Set Cloudflare Pages secrets:

```bash
pnpm dlx wrangler pages secret put HARNESS_URL --project-name ecom-research-agent
pnpm dlx wrangler pages secret put HARNESS_TOKEN --project-name ecom-research-agent
pnpm dlx wrangler pages secret put APP_PASSWORD --project-name ecom-research-agent
```

Deploy:

```bash
rm -rf dist
mkdir -p dist
cp index.html app.js styles.css .nojekyll dist/
pnpm dlx wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name ecom-research-agent
```

Give the public Pages URL and `APP_PASSWORD` to the intended user.
